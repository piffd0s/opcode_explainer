##
## Opcode Explainer (Web with Local Cache)
##
## Updated for IDA 7.xx / IDA 9 and Python 3
##
## This plugin fetches an explanation for the opcode under the cursor from 
## Felix Cloutierâ€™s x86 reference at: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/
## For the top 50 common opcodes, a local description (with two detailed sentences)
## is used to avoid web traffic. The second sentence details if and how flags are modified.
##
## To install:
##      Copy this script into your IDA plugins directory, e.g.,
##      C:\Program Files\<ida version>\plugins
##
## To use:
##      In the disassembly view, right-click on an instruction and select 
##      "Explain Opcode" to display a description.

    "mov":  "The MOV instruction transfers data from one location to another. It does not modify any processor flags.",

    "jmp":  "The JMP instruction causes an unconditional jump to a specified address. It does not affect the arithmetic flags.",
